[00:19.05]When you were here
  
[00:21.12]The stars disappear

[00:23.63]Nothing can outshine the dress that you wear

[00:28.96]We should be dancing

[00:31.72]'Cause girl you look stunning

[00:34.30]Let's spend the night together till reach the morning

[00:39.38]Up and above

[00:42.14]Never enough

[00:44.41]I want to hold your hand and show what is love

[00:49.26]When you are smiling

[00:52.03]And when you are laughing

[00:54.54]We should keep dancing to treasure the feelings

[00:59.35]Like it's the old love (it's the old love)

[01:04.89]This is the way that we both wanna feel

[01:09.94]Under the moonlight we made our first kiss

[01:14.96]'Cause this is the moment that you made me feel

[01:19.76]Like it's the old love (it's the old love)

[01:25.33]Come on and hold me, I want you right here

[01:30.11]Stay close to me so you don't feel the fear

[01:35.40]I'll never let go 'cause I'm just right here

[01:40.51]When I'm with you

[01:42.77]It's like déjà vu

[01:45.35]I realized that dreams really come true

[01:50.29]We keep on talking for the moment we live in

[01:55.45]Let's just keep drinking till the moon disappear

[02:00.51]You are the one

[02:03.27]The one that I want

[02:05.54]The one that will stay by my side till I'm gone

[02:10.39]The love of my life and I'll sacrifice

[02:15.72]Just for the moment we last long forever

[02:20.76]Like it's the old love (it's the old love)

[02:25.80]This is the way that we both wanna feel

[02:30.61]Under the moonlight we made our first kiss

[02:35.59]'Cause this is the moment that you made me feel

[02:40.77]Like it's the old love

[02:46.38]Come on and hold me, I want you right here

[02:51.19]Stay close to me so you don't feel the fear

[02:56.23]I'll never let go 'cause I'm just right her

[03:01.02]Like it's the old love

[03:22.18]Like it's the old love

[03:26.71]This is the way that we both wanna feel

[03:31.76]Under the moonlight we made our first kiss

[03:36.55]'Cause this is the moment that you made me feel

[03:41.67]Like it's the old love
